I am currently a PhD candidate at Key Laboratory of Geographic Information Science, Ministry of Education, School of Geographic Sciences, East China Normal University, supervised by [Prof. Min Liu](https://faculty.ecnu.edu.cn/_s33/lm2/main.psp). I received my Bachelor's degree from Inner Mongolia Agricultural University in 2017 and my Master's degree from School of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science, Jiangnan University in 2020, supervised by [Prof. Jun Sun](https://ai.jiangnan.edu.cn/info/1013/1505.htm). I have published more than 14 papers in cutting-edge international conferences and journals, including TGRS, JAG, etc. I have worked as a perception algorithm engineer at Leadmove, and have been a reviewer for top conferences and journals. My current research interest includes autonomous driving and intelligent interpretation, focusing on multimodal visual segmentation and detection.
